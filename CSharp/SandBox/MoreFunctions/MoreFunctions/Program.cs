     * Function 7:
     * 
     * Write a function that takes an argument.

     * The function should return the string with the longest word in the given string. 
     * If the longest words are more than one, 
     * the function should return the first of those words.
     * 
     * Examples:
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * For input (Anthony Bourdain's quote):
     * 
     * string text = "Without experimentation, a willingness to ask questions and try new things, we shall surely become static, repetitive, and moribund.";
     * 
     * The function should return the string: experimentation
     * 
     * 
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * For input (Beatles' song lyrics):
     * 
     * string text = "Close your eyes and I'll kiss you\nTomorrow I'll miss you\nRemember I'll always be true\nAnd then while I'm away\nI'll write home every day\nAnd I'll send all my loving to you";
     * 
     * The function should return the string: Tomorrow
     * 
     * Even though the two longest words in the sentence are "Tomorrow" and "Remember", "Tomorrow" comes first.
