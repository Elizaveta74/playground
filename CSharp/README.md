<details><summary>Print single-dimensional array elements</summary>
<hr>
You have an array:

````c#
int[] myArray = {1, -20, 23, -4, 8, -91, 0, 77, -4, 43, 11, -91};
````

* Loop through all elements of this array and print only numbers greater than 0.
* Solve this task using `for` loop, `while` loop and `do-while` loop.
* For every implementation (`for`-loop, `while` loop and `do-while` loop) create separate function (method) and call it accordingly.

[Implement this task in a console project](Tutorials/CreateConsoleProject.md)
